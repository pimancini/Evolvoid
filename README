Hi everybody! This is the EVOLVOID repository. 
EVOLVOID is a a computational pipeline based on genetic algorithms that generates virtual 3D cell constructs with optimized morphologies 
by simulating key biophysical principles — such as thermodynamic principles, nutrient transport and their uptake by cells.

In the first release (v1.0.0) you can download the zip file and run the main on MATLAB with the Global Optimization Toolbox.
